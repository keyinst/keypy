Each file (*.asc) is an EEG file in plain text format, with 2 seconds worth of data.
nch=61 (number of electrodes)
tf=512 (number of time frames)
sf=256 (sampling rate in Hz)

List with electrode names in correct order: List61e.txt

Two groups of participants were recorded: healthy controls (HC) and patients (PA). Recordings were done during two different eyes-closed conditions: resting (Rest) and a task (Task). Conditions were repeated for up to three runs per participant.


Subdirectory and data structure:

2 folders, 17 datafiles (2 s each)

File name convention:

Filename example: vp04_3.txt

*04*: participant number
*3*: run number


--- Note

This is a random extraction of EEG files to illustrate the EEG microstate analysis with keypy. If you are interested in a dataset that makes more sense to analyse from a content perspective, please look at data/input/dataset2.

Some runs for some participants are missing in order to illustrate how keypy deals with missing values.
